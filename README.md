# Gank.io Desktop

Yet another [gank.io](http://gank.io) client.

## Build & Install

To build **Gank.io Desktop**, you would need to install the following dependencies:

- GTK+ 3.20
  - This may shock you, but yes, **I haven't tested on lower versions yet. Compability reports are welcomed.**

On Linux, simply type `make && make install` to make it be at post.

On Windows, you will need **MSYS2** or **Cygwin** for they offer GTK+ libraries. However, you can also DIY.
